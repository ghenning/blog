I originally planned on hosting this blog on Heroku through a Jekyll Docker container. For some reason it's a frustratingly complex thing to do so I gave in and went with the more standard way of hosting it on github. Maybe I'll write a post here at some point on that experience.

Since I finally started this thing, I need to come up with ideas on what to write about. I'll probably come up with some tech-related things to write about and share stuff that I learn that could be helpful by documenting it. 

A simple tech-blog sounds a bit dry and boring though, so I want to write about other things as well. I definitely have some stories from my golfing and science days that can be worth writing about. Sports, beer, and video games are definitely on the menu, and I could also sprinkle in some music and science topics. On top of all that I can write general updates on what's happening in my life (without doxxing myself). That way my family and friends can keep up with my life (if they're interested).

With all these various topics this will become a smorgasbord blog. Therefore I'll try to use the tags so people can view the type of topics they want. I'll try to keep posting on a somewhat regular basis, we'll see what happens.

Ok bye.
