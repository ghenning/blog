This story is from a tournament trip with the national team to Hungary. It was held at a place called Polus Palace in a small town just outside of Budapest. Polus Palace had a very interesting backstory. There was this rich guy (I'm assuming his name is Polus) that decided to build a 5-star hotel and a golf course in the hotel's backyard. To gain some exposure in the golfing world for his new establishment he decided to host a tournament.

The exact location of Polus Palace, to me at least, is odd. Yes, it's only a 30-minute drive from Budapest, but it's the immediate surroundings that confuse me. A 5-star hotel with a nice golf course surrounded by a very run-down and unwelcoming neighbourhood. On our first day we went for a walk to buy some snacks. Every house we saw was surrounded by barbed wire and most of them had a guard dog in the yard. We half-joked among ourselves that we could get mugged (or worse) at any moment. We zoomed through the shop, picking whatever snacks we needed, followed by a brisk walk back to the hotel. Out of self-preservation we did not leave the hotel again.

I'm no stranger to air travel and luggage issues. There were a few years when I always assumed the worst about my luggage, and *if* I would receive my luggae I would classify it as a happy accident. If memory serves me right, this was the trip that started my luggage curse.

When traveling for golf, you have two pieces of luggage: your golf clubs and your standard luggage. In our group, all golf clubs arrived, but two pieces of luggage were missing. Of course one of those was mine. The helpdesk at the airport said they'd taxi it over to us if they managed to find it. For national team trips there's usually a "captain" with the group, someone affiliated with the golf association. Usually it's the national team coach or assisstant coach. On the second day our captain tells us that only one of the lost luggage was found the night before and had arrived in the morning. We all thought he was joking, but no, indeed only one suitcase had arrived, and it wasn't mine. 

At tournaments like this we usually have two days of practice rounds, followed by 3-4 days of tournament rounds. We were about to go for our first day of practice, and I was without clothes. To solve it I had to borrow clothes from our captain. It's a strange feeling trying to get ready for a tournament while wearing someone else's clothes. Luckily my suitcase ended up finding its way to Polus Palace, but the first two days I had to wear the captain's clothes.

One guy in our team was a big slugger (i.e. he could hit the ball really far). He loved to make declarations of his long-hitting skills. The first hole of the course was a fairly short par-4, and after the practice rounds he proudly stated the he could hit the green in one shot with a 3-wood. The logical way to play the hole was to hit an iron off the tee due to hazards on the way to the green, setting up for a simple approach shot. So, first day of the tournament he whips out his 3-wood, puts his ball down without teeing it up, and then tops the ball into a pond that was 20 meters in front of the tee that was just there for aesthetic purposes. He then walks back to his bag, grabs a new ball and an iron and played the hole the logical way. Few times in my life have I had to try so hard not pissing myself laughing.

There's more to tell from our slugger during this tournament. The second day of the tournament when we were all out on the course playing I heard some shouting. It was another guy from our team, running and shouting our captain's name trying to find him. He was doing that because he saw our slugger get hit in the head with a golf ball from an adjacent hole. All play in that general area paused because everyone wanted to know what the noise was about. I saw our slugger friend walking off the course with a blood-covered towel pressed against his head. So the slugger and the captain had to go to the hospital, and we had to continue playing. In stroke-play team tournaments the best rounds of the day count (4 out of 5, 5 out of 6, etc.), so the slugger's score that day would be the one we'd drop. That wasn't exactly a comforting thought because we were simply worrying about our friend's well-being, so finishing our round wasn't exactly easy. Luckily he only had to get some stitches in his head, but the bandaging work was hilarious. There was so much bandaging on his head that he could've been mistaken as a mummy. But he sported his mummy bandaging well and played the rest of the tournament without issues. 

So, that's the story of my Hungary trip: getting our luggage piece by piece, playing in other people's clothes, followed by a team-mate having to go to the hospital. Quite eventful week at the Polus Palace. By the way, I googled the place, it's permanently closed. Honestly, it doesn't surprise me because the location of such a fancy place in the middle of where it was does not make any sense.

Ok, bye.
