I started drinking coffee in my early 20s. That brown bean soup definitely helped me through university, especially my masters. I'd be at the office on average 12 hours every day, and coffee was a big factor in helping me cope with that. 

I kept the same coffee drinking going when I started my PhD, downing multiple cups every day. Things went on like this for the first six months or so until one day where I was probably extremely busy and getting coffee simply must have slipped my mind. Accidentally breaking my habit must have done something to my brain, because I forgot about coffee the whole rest of the week. It didn't occur to me that I hadn't been drinking coffee until the weekend. I decided to try to see how long I could go without coffee. Turns out it was simple, I never had any caffeine cravings so I just ended up quitting coffee.

Coffee has a unique taste that is very much acquired. I've had maybe a handful of coffee cups in the years since I quit and they've all tasted like good old coffee, so I never lost that taste. However, I have always, and always will hate anything with an added coffee taste (ice cream, chocolate, etc.). Adding coffee taste to things does not make sense to me, it's as absurd as adding sour candy taste to a hamburger.

I had an interesting experience with coffee when I went to visit my old research group in Iceland in 2021. This was roughly five years after I had quit coffee, but I decided to have a couple of cups with the old gang. My brain became all wired and it was almost like being high. I visited my sister afterwards and that's where the effects started winding down and I came down hard with a caffeine crash. Holy moly did it hit hard. I thought maybe I could just die in peace on my sister's sofa. Luckily I survived and life went on. Maybe I will think twice before drinking another cup of coffee.

Ok, bye.
