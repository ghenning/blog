Imagine a scenario where you need to talk to someone in a bureaucratic position. You know enough German to get by on a day-to-day basis (grocery stores, restuarants, and that kind of stuff). However, the bureaucrat starts throwing out complex, 80 syllable words and you become a human question mark. You politely ask if they could switch to English, or if you could talk to someone who speaks English. The bureaucrat frowns and snarkily says a phrase commonly used in Germany:

*"You know you're in Germany, right?"*

The absurdity of this phrase is hilariously depressing. Yes, I am aware of which country I'm in. Yes, my German could be better. However, English is (probably) the most widespread language in the world and is the de facto international business/science/media language. It is also the second language in (I'm guessing) the majority of European countries. Given that Germany is a 1st world country with good education (literally tops the eduaction index list) I'd expect more people to be willing to communicate in English. 

Let's dig a bit deeper. Around 15% percent of people in Germany are foreign nationals. Unless they get help with their registration and all that stuff, they need professional-level German to get through all the documents because Germans don't really bother to translate documents. Looking at my city, Bonn, foreigner numbers are closer to 20%. There is a big university in the city, and the German United Nations campus is here as well. All this makes the city look very international, right? Yet somehow it looks like you're less of a person if you're not familiar with complex, contractual German. 

There are reasons why my German isn't as good as it could be (topic for another post), yet on a day-to-day basis I get by just fine. If they could translate documents and have English speaking people in bureaucratic positions, even if I'd have to make special appointments for those, Germany would take a giant leap into the modern world. This is tied to something that is pretty much non-existent in Germany, customer service, which is a big enough topic for its own post.

I have mostly experienced this from bureaucrats, but you hear this every now and then from others. I've encountered other Germans saying this to me when I discuss this problem, I've heard it on a train that was literally leaving Germany to another country, and in customer service. 

This might sound a bit harsh towards Germany, but the country needs to come to terms with the reality that people from all over the world move to places all over the world for various reasons. I'm not saying Germany is a terrible place that you should place a big, red **X** on it on the world map. There are good things about Germany too, and there are lots of great people here. Just compromise a little bit (that applies to me too, of course): have things available in English and I can keep improving my everyday-German.

Ironically, I'd wager many Germans would react to this post with *"You know you're in Germany, right?"*, but that's just how the bratwurst rolls.

Ok, bye.
