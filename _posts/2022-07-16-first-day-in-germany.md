My first day in Germany was quite the rollercoaster, so let's document it.

Early morning I hop on a plane to Germany. Once I get there it's nice and sunny out, a perfect Friday. I grab a bus to my new office to sign my contract and meet the people there. Smooth sailing so far.

Next up I make my way to my new apartment. I meet the previous tenant to get the keys and have them show me around the house. For some tens of euros they leave me their old desk, chair, and closet. A good deal for me, less stuff I need look for for the place. Now all I have to do is wait for the mattress I orderer that was supposed to arrive in the afternoon. The smooth sailing continues. Something is bound to go wrong, right?

I keep waiting for the mattress, but DHL is not showing up. So I keep waiting, and waiting, nothing... Now, here's an interesting fact about deliveries in Germany: They don't always deliver your stuff. Sometimes the delivery drivers don't feel like delivering your package so they just take it to a packet station at the end of their shift, and you're stuck with having to go there and pick up your package. Perfect, right? Especially when you pay extra for express delivery. The best thing about this fantastic, German custom? Usually when this happens, it's the big packages. So I had to spend my first weekend sleeping on the floor, and later on dragging a mattress home from the packet station.

But that wasn't my whole first-day experience. I needed to do something silly myself. After waiting until 8 PM for the mattress delivery I gave up waiting and went to the grocery store to get some food. I come back from the store, ready to finally eat after a long day. But something weird is happening, the key to my apartment isn't working. I keep trying and trying while performing gymnastic maneuvers on the door. But the door won't budge. Mama mia, I'm locked out of my apartment on my first day. I decide to step outside and try to telepathically reason with the house. That's when I got a brilliant idea, I should try again! I stroll to my apartment, jam they key in, and magically it opens on the first try. That's when it dawned on me, I had been trying to open an apartment on the floor above mine... Whoopsie doopsie. I just hope no one was home when I was trying to "break in" to their apartment. 

And that's my first day in Germany. I made it through alive, but had to sleep on the floor and accidentally tried to break into someone's apartment. Not too bad.

Ok, bye.
