                    <p>I’ve had academic group directors in both Iceland and Germany. Luckily, they are fantastic people that want you to succeed. They also understand that you need to have life outside of academia, and encourage you to do so. This post is not about them though. I just wanted to give them some praise and remind myself that I’ve been lucky so far in the director lottery.</p>

<p>This post is about the exact opposite. A director of another group at my old institute that ticks every box of what I’d not like to have in a director. I won’t be naming anyone, but people who have worked with me will immediately know who this is. Let’s call this director <em>D</em> for short.</p>

<p>The word I’d probably use to describe <em>D</em> is a megalomaniac (<em>a person who has an obsessive desire for power</em>). Don’t get me wrong, <em>D</em> is very smart and accomplished in their field and their success is deserved. However, an outside view of their group shows a cultivation of cutthroat science and a work-comes-first mentality. <em>D</em> even denied the extremely reasonable request of the group to have a lunch table on their floor. Note that this is what it looks like from the outside, I don’t know if this is really the case when one’s in the group (the lunch table thing is real, though).</p>

<p>Now, enough speculation and on to my encounters with <em>D</em>. My old institute is a part of an academic society with a bunch of institutes of various disciplines scattered around Germany. The society has rules which the institutes should follow. However, it seems that these rules are more like guidelines and each institute director can decide how much to-the-letter they want to follow these rules. My institute has a few group directors that swap between themselves every couple of years who is the institute director.</p>

<p>One of the rules that the institutes are supposed to follow is to provide German language courses up to a certain level (B2 if I remember correctly). Me and some others were taking these classes and we were up to something like A2/B1 level. Unfortunately for us, <em>D</em> was the institute director at the time, and they didn’t think that enough people were taking this course and that this was a waste of money. What did <em>D</em> do? Well, cancel the course, of course, completely ignoring the “rules”… After some complaining it was decided that those who wanted to continue to learn could find a class somewhere in the city and the institute would pay a certain amount to help cover the costs. I liked the classes that we had because it was with people I knew, free, and at the institute. Now I had to go and find a class held somewhere in the city (and deal with German customer service to find a class appropriate to my level and such), pay for it and get some of it paid back from the institute. And this was of course some months after the in-house classes were cancelled, and I hadn’t touched German for a while and had completely lost momentum and interest. So, out of spite/lazyness/inconvenience/… I decided not to take this deal and just stop my German learning.</p>

<p>And now we arrive at the more juicy interaction I’ve had with <em>D</em> (the reason I decided to write this post). Observing with our telescope is not exactly trivial. First, a telescope proposal is required to obtain some telescope time. Then you need to coordinate with the telescope scheduling wizard (who is great by the way, just wanted to throw a little bit of positivity in here) to find a time that fits into the telescope schedule and a time when the source you want to observe is visible from the telescope. When observing, if something goes wrong (broken receiver, weather stopping observations, and a plethora of other things that can go wrong) it’s simply bad luck, you don’t get the telescope time back. Now, onto the good stuff. I was about to start my observations on a Friday night and ask the telescope operator when I can start. He tells me there’s a delay and I have to wait a bit longer. No problem, this happens all the time, some delays are bound to happen. I ask again a bit later and the operator tells me to hang on, he’s going to check what’s going on. He comes back and tells me that <em>D</em> is up on the telescope dish doing a photoshoot! I am stunned. Roughly an hour and a half after my observations were supposed to start (out of 4 hours total) the operator finally gets back to me and says I can start observing. Why, just why, would <em>D</em> do this. They know that the telescope schedule is tightly packed, and each hour is valuable both science-wise and money-wise. Apparently <em>D</em> didn’t care, as they needed that sweet sweet nighttime telescope photoshoot. I thought that maybe this was for the national news or something like that, so I shouldn’t be too angry or judgemental. I also would’ve been more forgiving if <em>D</em> had notified me (way) ahead of time that I’d lose some of my telescope time. And what was this all-important photoshoot for? Some damn science blog…</p>

<p>Ok, bye.</p>
