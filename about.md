# About 
I'm a bearded nerd with a PhD in Astronomy. From 2016 to 2021 I worked as a doctoral and post-doctoral researcher, investigating fast radio bursts. Programming is something that interests me and I'm keen on improving my skills in that area. General interests of mine include (but are not limited to) football, golf, badminton, beer, dogs, music, and video games. Here one can find random ramblings of mine.

Check out my non-blog webpage [here](https://ghenning.github.io).

I'm a big fan of dark themes, hence the outlook of this blog. You can find the template, called `jekyll-clean-dark`, [here](https://github.com/streetturtle/jekyll-clean-dark/tree/gh-pages/_includes).
